## Testing page-summary module w/integration tests

Because the all the page-summary modules borrow their view from default-page-summary in 
@msdyn365-commerce-modules/core-components, we've written integration tests to test that the modules are working as intended.

To run the integration tests, move the `test` folder outside the src directory to the page-summary root level (where the package.json lives).

Run `yarn d365b build` to generate a build including the server. This is needed because the integration tests require the server components to render the pages.
Do not run `yarn build`. Running `yarn build` will generate a distributable of the module and will not include server components which will cause the integration tests to fail.

Finally run `yarn integration` to run the integration tests

TL;DR
1. Move the `test` folder out to the root level of `page-summary`.
2. Run `yarn d365b build`.
3. Run `yarn integration` to run the tests.
